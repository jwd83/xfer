make a downloadable plan.md describing the MVP for the following project:

a single page web app where a user can select a file and the app will generate a
link for them to send to a friend to download the file from them. the person sending the file and the person receiving the file is the receiver. they will connect to each other p2p with the randomly generated url acting as the connection key. the app should use webRTC for the p2p connection and should not store any files on a server. the app should also have a simple and clean UI.
